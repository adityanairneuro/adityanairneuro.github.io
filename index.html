<p1>The brain displays a dazzling amount of complexity, with brain cells of all shapes and sizes (which I took photos of and digitally reconstructed above!) driving our perceptions, thoughts and emotions. </p1>
<br>
			<br>
<p1>Unravelling this complexity is the heart of neuroscience and something I hope to contribute to in grad school at <a href = "https://www.caltech.edu">Caltech</a> at the lab of <a href = "https://davidandersonlab.caltech.edu/davidanderson">David J Anderson</a>. </p1>
<br>

<p1> At graduate school, I study the neural implementation of emotions using theoritical and experimental approaches, searching for a unifying principle that the brain uses to implement diverse emotions from aggression to fear. Many of these ideas stem from decades of work by David Anderson who hypothesized that all emotions possess universal properties he named emotional primitives. You can read more about this work here: <a href = "https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(14)00292-X">A Framework for Studying Emotions across Species</a> </p1>
<br>
			<br>	
<p1>I'm co-advised on this quest by <a href = "https://sites.northwestern.edu/kennedylab/ann/">Ann Kennedy</a>, a theorist at Northwestern University who pioneered a theoritical approach to understanding emotions in the hypothalamus. I also work closely with and I am also advised by <a href = "https://ganguli-gang.stanford.edu/surya.html">Surya Ganguli</a>, with whom I apply concepts from dynamical systems into the study of emotion, and by <a href = "https://pyramidal.stanford.edu/index.html">Mark Schnitzer</a>, who provides crticial theoritical and experimental help, providing new microscopic tools that allow us to study the brain at an incredible resolution.</p1>
<br>

<p1>My exposure to neuroscience stems from our experiences at the lab of <a href = "https://ki.se/en/neuro/silberberg-lab" >Gilad Silberberg</a> during my undergraduate at the <a href = "https://ki.se/en" >Karolinska Institute</a> and later at the lab of <a href = "http://www.lkcmedicine.ntu.edu.sg/aboutus/Faculty-and-Staff/Pages/George-Augustine.aspx" >George Augustine</a> during my thesis and post baccalaureate year at the <a href = "https://www.a-star.edu.sg">Agency of Science, Technology and Research, Singapore</a>.</p1>
